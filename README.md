## Project Timeline
 
A mistaken student once said:

> I don't know what I could be working on.

There will always be more work to be done for Mercury.Checkpoints are important because they allow us to track our progress and avoid the excuse that we have to wait on another component of the robot to be finished before progressing. _This is a myth._ I believe that as long as the team is informed on the status of our robot and what needs to be completed next, we can deliver a successful product on time. Therefore, although subject to change, this section should provide a tentative summmary for our team's development process.
