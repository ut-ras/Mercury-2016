## Project Timeline
 
####A student once said:

> I don't know what I could be working on.
>
> I am waiting for someone else to finish their part.

Don't make these mistakes! We must avoid these mentalities since there will always be more work to be done for Mercury. I believe that through better communication of our goals and expectations we can deliver a successful product on time. As a result, this section should provide a tentative summmary for tracking our team's progress.
