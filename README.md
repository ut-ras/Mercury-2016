## Project Timeline
 
####A mistaken student once said:

> I don't know what I could be working on.

There will always be more work to be done for Mercury. We should not use the excuse of waiting on someone else to do our own part for the team. I believe we can deliver a successful product on time if we avoid this mentality. Therefore, although subject to change, this section should provide a tentative summmary for our team's development progress.
