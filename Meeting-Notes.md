## Purpose

This page documents the meeting dates and important decisions made during 2016 Mercury Robotics Competition.

___
### 4 Dec 15

First official meeting of the Mercury 2016 team. Six leaders met to discuss general strategies for the upcoming competition.
The strategies decided upon were fed from lessons learned of the 2015 Mercury team.

* Forward bias all coding tasks for longer testing and integration times
* Implement two timelines for Mercury administrative processes and robot design milestones
* Reduce lead times on ordering parts
* Constrain design teams to predefined requirements. 

The team decided to constrain electronic hardware to an Arduino and a Raspberry Pi and software to ROS libraries (subject to change).
